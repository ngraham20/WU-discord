<h2>What is Discord?</h2>
<p>Discord is a software that was built for gamers. Its original purpose was to make it easier for large groups of people to effectively communicate with each other as easily as possible. Think about the size of some World of Warcraft guilds and how big some of the boss raids are. That number is higher than any class you've been in at Whitworth. Because of this, Discord is a perfect choice to allow effective communication between you, your classmates, and your teachers.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> This document will only cover the absolute basics on what Discord is and how to use it. If you like what you see and want a more detailed explaination, check out Discord's <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord">Beginner's Guide to Discord</a>. This covers a <em>huge</em> amount of information, including how to change your sound and video settings for if things go wrong on your end and even how permissions work so you understand why you can't see everything your professors and TAs can see.</p>
<h2>Installing</h2>
<p>Installing Discord doesn't need to be a hastle, but there are a couple things to keep in mind in order for class to run smoothly.</p>
<ol>
<li>First and formost, you <strong>need</strong> to download either the desktop application or the mobile app. There is a way to use discord right inside your browser, but several of the features we will be using are much harder to work with when used through the web browser.</li>
<li>Next, Head on over to <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord's homepage</a>. There, you will find a download link. <img src="https://imgur.com/lZt0kJD.png" alt="discord-image" /> In this example, the button says <code>Download for Linux</code>, but it will most likely say <code>Download for Windows</code>. Click that button and download Discord to your computer.</li>
<li>When given the option to <code>save</code> or <code>open</code> the downloaded file, choose <code>open</code>. This will cause Windows to begin installing Discord for you.</li>
<li>Discord should open once it's installed. If not, please contact your professor, who will either help you troubleshoot or direct you to someone who can help.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Once you have Discord open, you will be asked to either log in or create an account. Now is the time to create an account if you don't already have one.</p>
<p>If you have made a Discord account before, log in using your credentials.<br />
<img src="https://imgur.com/5nz613h.png" alt="Discord Login" /></p>
<p>If you haven't made a Discord account before, click the <code>Register</code> button, which is located underneath the <code>Login</code> button.</p>
<p>Here, you can create a new account.<br />

<h2>The Basics</h2>
<p>This section will cover the basics of using Discord. As mentioned above, for a more detailed explaination of the things mentioned in this document or to learn about things that are not, please check out Discord's <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord">Beginner's Guide to Discord</a>.</p>
<h3>Joining a Discord Server</h3>
<p>There are two basic methods to join a server. Both methods require an invite link or invite code for the server you are trying to join. The link will follow the format</p>
<pre lang="http"><code>https://discord.gg/INVITE_CODE
</code></pre>
<p>Your professor will give you this code either in an email or other form of communication. Keep a look out for it, as you will not be able to join your class servers without it.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The easiest and simplest method is to click the link your professor has given you. It should open Discord for you automatically and bring up the invitation screen. If this does not happen, you may need to use the next method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Discord, look on the lefthand side of the screen. This is your server list. At the bottom, there is a <strong>ðŸž¤</strong> button. This button allows you to add a server, giving you the choice to <code>add</code> or <code>join</code> a server. Paste the invite link there, and click <code>Join</code>.<br />
<img src="https://imgur.com/3Cd7yDI.png" alt="Discord Main Page" /></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once a server is added, simply click the icon on the left to view the voice and text channels in the server. You can bounce back and forth between many servers. You can even read text channels from one server while in a voice channel in another. This is particularly helpful when you're talking with someone and need to find information from another server.</p>
<h3>Joining a Channel</h3>
<p>Joining a text channel is as simple as clicking on the channel.</p>
<p>To join a voice chanel, simply click on the channel. You will automatically join the voice channel. You can continue to use other text channels while you are in a voice channel; however, if you click another voice channel, you will immediately switch to that voice channel.</p>
<p>While in a voice channel, a pannel will appear on the lower lefthand corner of your screen.</p>
<ul>
<li>The bars next to <code>Voice Connected</code> indicate your connection strength. The text underneath indicates which channel you're currently connected to.</li>
<li>The phone button is what you click to disconnect from a voice channel.<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Discord will not automatically remove you from a voice channel. If you forget to disconnect, there is a high likleyhood that you will be heard without you being aware.<br />
<img src="https://imgur.com/q0WiBEy.png" alt="Discord Voice Channel" /></li>
<li>Click <code>Video</code> to turn your webcam on for face-to-face conversation.</li>
<li>Click <code>Screen</code> to begin a screenshare. The <code>Applications</code> tab will allow you to only share a particular application, while the <code>Screens</code> tab allows you to share an entire screen. This is a helpful distinction to keep in mind.<br />
<img src="https://imgur.com/vCgklfQ.png" alt="Discord Go Live" /></li>
</ul>
<h3>Pinging</h3>
<p>In Discord, you can ping users and roles by using the <code>@</code> symbol. This allows you to get the attention of someone on the server, who may not actually be using Discord at the moment. A notification will be sent to all users in a given role or to the single pinged user.</p>
<p>As an example, if you believe you should be able to access a channel, but you can't, try finding a help text channel or go to a general text channel and type a message like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can any <code>@Technician</code> help me get into a channel? I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to be able to get in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By pinging <code>@Technician</code>, all technicians will get pinged, and one of them may be able to help you.</p>
<h2>SNWU (The Whitworth Spanish Tutoring Server)</h2>
<p>Spanish tutoring will be primarily, if not entirely held here on Discord. Many features have been set up so that office hours are well known and it's easy to tell when a tutor is online.</p>
<h3>Roles</h3>
<p>There are many roles on this server that are helpful to keep in mind. They are listed on the righthand side of the screen, and they will be listed separately from the rest of the people who are online.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> A Whitworth Professor - This is the person to ping with questions regarding assignments and schedules. Keep in mind though, that this is the tutoring server and all questions will be seen by everyone. It would be better to email your professor directly than ask too detailed of a question here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tutor:</strong> A Spanish tutor - This role is assigned to students who are experianced in Spanish and either has the answer to whatever question you may have or they know how to find it. Tutors will hold office hours, which can be found in the <code>Office Hours</code> channel pins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Technician:</strong> Someone with a deeper knowledge of Discord and how it works. - This is the role to ping with issues with the server.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Channels</h3>
<p>These channels are all contained within categories, grouped by use.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Public:</strong> All public channels are held here. The <code>Welcome</code> channel, <code>FAQ</code>, <code>Anouncements</code>, and <code>help</code> are all here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fun and Games:</strong> Here, please feel free to loosen up and have some fun. After all, since most of us won't be seeing each other in person for the time being, it's <strong>extremely</strong> important to keep our community together. All channels in this category are meant for memes, games, random conversations, and more. If you have suggestions for online video games we might want to all play together, please feel free to suggest that to someone in charge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tutoring:</strong> All tutoring will happen here. You may notice that there is a waiting room channel and three voice channels. The three voice channels are visible, but not accessible to students. During a tutor's office hours, you will see them in the voice channels (you will see their icons indicating they're in the channels). To join the chat, enter the waiting room. You won't be able to talk to or hear anyone else in the waiting room with you. In the waiting room text channel, ping one of the tutors, who will pull you into the voice channel with them for tutoring.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> if you are not in the waiting room, the tutor will not be able to pull you into the voice channel.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Kim's Classes</h2>
<h3>Roles</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> The professor in charge of this class (Profe Kim).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Student:</strong> All students will have the <code>Student</code> role, which allows Kim to ping all students at once for announcements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TA:</strong> This role is assigned to your TA(s). If you have any questions and your professor is busy, try pinging your TA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Technician:</strong> Someone with a deeper knowledge of Discord and how it works. - This is the role to ping with issues with the server.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Channels</h3>
<p>For all of Profe Kim's classes, the class servers will be organized the same. On the lefthand side, the channels are grouped by use.</p>
<ul>
<li>The general channels and information channels are located at the top and are not categorized.</li>
<li>Class will be held in <code>ClasePrimario</code>. To attend class, click on the voice channel. If your professor is sharing their screen, a <code>Live</code> indicator will appear on that voice channel. Hover your mouse cursor over the channel, and you will be given the option to join the stream. Do so, and you will see your professor's screenshare.</li>
<li>The <code>Groupo</code> channels will be hidden initially, so there's no need to be confused if you don't see them. These will be used as breakout groups for private small group discussion. When it's time for them to be used, you will discover you can see your group's chat category.</li>
<li>The <code>Asignaciones</code> category will hold your assignments. Please remember to check the pins.</li>
</ul>
